# codeclan_homework_ColinS
Repo for submission of homework exercises

This repo contains homework submissions for CodeClan's 
14-week Professional Data Analysis course.

Homework was completed whenever it was issued, and 
this repo contains work in R, SQL and RShiny.

Homework tasks depend entirely on the work being done
in class.  Some days and weeks are "missing" from this
repor either because no homework was issued on that
specific day, or because other larger projects were
in progress.  

These other projects will be made publicly available
on GitHub as soon as possible.
