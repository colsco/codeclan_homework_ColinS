The "games" project was a homework task during the CodeClan
Professional Data Analysis course.

The file structure consists of a shiny dashboard
based on the sales data from several games developers.

The file structure is as follows;

'www' -> Image store
Four .R scripts, "global", "server", "setups" and "ui" for running the dashboard.

The .Rproj file is located in the task top level directory.
